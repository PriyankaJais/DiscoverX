# DiscoverX

DiscoverX is an app to explore SpaceX launches.

It fetches a list of launches and company information using SpaceX APIs.

It is built using Swift 5 and Xcode 13.3.1

It has a filter screen which has options to filter for only successful launches, filter by launch years
and to sort by ascending/descending order of launch years.

It also has a clear button which clears all applied filters and goes back to the main list showing all launches.

To refresh the list, the app has a pull to refresh feature.

The launch list has a context menu for navigating to the article, wikipedia link or video link if available.
